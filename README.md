# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. I have created it during my early learning stage in Python. It is a beginner level project.
The project is simple to implement from which I understood very well about how Lists, loops and other basic things operate in Python.
Coming to project, it is a 2-player game. At the beginning of the game computer asks for one player's marker and assign assign opposite marker to another player.
Then computer randomly chooses first turn with random function.
Now for every player's turn, the computer displays board which is nothing but a list with size 9, then asks current player to choose a position to mark his/her symbol then computer checks whether that particular position is empty or not, if it is not empty then it asks again untill player gives valid input. 
If it is empty then computer marks symbol and checks whether there is a combination that can give victory to the current player and if such combination exists then game ends saying that the current player is winner. 
Otherwise computer will check for "Draw" condition, if there is no Draw then it will give chance to next player.
And this game will continue untill either one of the players has won or it is a draw match. Lastly computer asks for replay and does accordingly to the selected option.
